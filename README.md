# ahk-jxon

This is an extension package intended to be used with the Python [ahk](https://github.com/spyoungtech/ahk) package.

It provides interfaces from [cocobelgica/AutoHotkey-JSON](https://github.com/cocobelgica/AutoHotkey-JSON) for
working with JSON in AutoHotkey. The extensions in this package do not provide any additional methods,
but simply provide a convenient way to include `Jxon.ahk` and/or `JSON.ahk` into other extensions.
